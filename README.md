# Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) sdl12-compat

https://www.libsdl.org/

This is the Simple DirectMedia Layer, a general API that provides low
level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, 3D hardware via OpenGL,
and 2D framebuffer across multiple platforms.

This code is a compatibility layer; it provides a binary and source
compatible API for programs written against SDL 1.2, but it uses SDL 2.0
behind the scenes. If you are writing new code, please target SDL 2.0
directly and do not use this layer.

If you absolutely must have the real SDL 1.2 ("SDL 1.2 Classic"), please use
the source tree at https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL-1.2, which occasionally
gets bug fixes but no formal release. But we strongly encourage you not to do
that.

# How to use:

- Build the library. This will need access to SDL2's headers (v2.0.7 or newer),
[CMake](https://cmake.org/) and the build tools of your choice. Once built, you
will have a drop-in replacement that can be used with any existing binary
that relies on SDL 1.2. You can copy this library over the existing 1.2 build,
or force it to take priority over a system copy with LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc.
At runtime, sdl12-compat needs to be able to find a copy of SDL2 (v2.0.7 or
newer -- v2.0.12 or newer for Windows), so plan to include it with the library
if necessary.

- If you want to build an SDL 1.2 program from source code, we have included
compatibility headers, so that sdl12-compat can completely replace SDL 1.2
at all points. These headers are just the bare minimum needed for source-level
compatibility and don't have a lot of documentation or fanciness at all. The
new headers are also under the zlib license. Note that sdl12-compat itself
does not use these headers, so if you just want the library, you don't need
them.

# Configuration options:

sdl12-compat has a number of configuration options which can be used to work
around issues with individual applications, or to better fit your system or
preferences.

These options are all specified as environment variables, and can be set by
running your application with them set on the command-line, for example:
```
SDL12COMPAT_HIGHDPI=1 SDL12COMPAT_OPENGL_SCALING=0 %command%
```
will run ``%command%`` with high-dpi monitor support enabled, but OpenGL
scaling support disabled.

The available options are:

- ``SDL12COMPAT_DEBUG_LOGGING`` — if enabled, print debugging messages to
  ``stderr``. These messages are mostly useful to developers, or if trying to
  track down a specific bug.
- ``SDL12COMPAT_FAKE_CDROM_PATH`` — a path to a directory containing MP3 files
  (named trackXX.mp3, where XX is a two-digit track number) to be used by
  applications which play CD audio.
- ``SDL12COMPAT_OPENGL_SCALING`` — enables scaling of OpenGL applications to
  the current desktop resolution. If disabled, applications can change the
  real screen resolution. This option is enabled by default, but not all
  applications are compatible with it: try changing this if you can only see
  a black screen.
- ``SDL12COMPAT_SYNC_TO_VBLANK`` — force the application to sync (or not sync)
  to the vertical blanking interval (VSync). When enabled, this will cap the
  application's framerate to the screen's refresh rate (and may resolve issues
  with screen tearing).
- ``SDL12COMPAT_SCALE_METHOD`` — choose the scaling method used when
  applications render at a non-native resolution. The options are ``nearest``,
  for nearest-neighbour sampling (more pixelated) and ``linear`` for bilinear
  sampling (blurrier).
- ``SDL12COMPAT_HIGHDPI`` — advertise the application as supporting high-DPI
  displays. Enabling this will usually result in sharper graphics, but on some
  applications text and other elements may become very small.
- ``SDL12COMPAT_USE_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT`` — make all keyboard input take the current
  keyboard layout into account. This may need to be disabled for applications
  which provide their own keyboard layout support, or if the position of the
  keys on the keyboard is more important than the character they produce. Note
  that text input (in most applications) will take the keyboard layout into
  account regardless of this option.
- ``SDL_MOUSE_RELATIVE_SCALING`` — if enabled, relative mouse motion is scaled
  when the application is running at a non-native resolution. This may be
  required with some applications which use their own mouse cursors. See also
