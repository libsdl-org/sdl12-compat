Bugs are now managed in GitHub Issues, here:

    https://github.com/libsdl-org/sdl12-compat/issues

You may report bugs there, and search to see if a given issue has already
 been reported, discussed, and maybe even fixed.



You may also find help at the SDL forums:

    https://discourse.libsdl.org/

Bug reports are welcome here, but we really appreciate if you use the bug
 tracker, as bugs discussed on the forums may be forgotten or missed.
