Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL for short) is a cross-platform library
designed to make it easy to write multi-media software, such as games
and emulators.

You can find the latest release and additional information at:
https://www.libsdl.org/

This code is a compatibility layer; it provides a binary and source
compatible API for programs written against SDL 1.2, but it uses SDL 2.0
behind the scenes. If you are writing new code, please target SDL 3.0
directly and do not use this layer.

Installation instructions are available in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

This library is distributed under the terms of the zlib license,
available in [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt).

Enjoy!
